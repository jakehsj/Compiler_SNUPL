# Term Project: Implementing a SnuPL/2 Compiler

In this term project, we implement a compiler for the SnuPL/2 language. 
The compiler accepts SnuPL/2 source code as an input and outputs to Intel assembly code.

SnuPL/2 is an imperative procedural language closely related to the [Oberon programming language](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/Oberon/index.html).
While SnuPL/2 does not support all standard features of a programming language such as floating point, user-defined data types, or pointer types, the language is complex enough to illustrate the basic concepts of a compiler.

## Language Specification
Refer to the [SnuPL/2 language specification](specification/SnuPL2.md).


## Phases

The project is split into the following phases:

| Phase | Topic                                                  |
